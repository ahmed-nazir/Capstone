\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Our team plans on having in person meetings weekly on Mondays from 2:30-4:30PM. These meetings will be used to catch up on work done in the last week, next steps and any important updates. If in person meetings are not possible we will conduct them through Microsoft Teams. This weekly meeting is mandatory but we might also have other meetings throughout the week depending on what stage we are in for the project. All meetings will contain an agenda and each team lead will give updates on next steps 

\section{Team Communication Plan}
Our team will be using a Microsoft Teams group as our main method of chat, and to delegate tasks we will be utilizing GitHubs project tracker

\section{Team Member Roles}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\subsection{Programming Language}

The programming language of choice is Python. Python is the perfect language for data analysis and data manipulation. Python contains many libraries specifically for data analysis. 

\subsubsection{Libraries}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pandas: Data manipulation library
	\item Matplotlib: Math library to help visualize data in graphs
	\item PyQT: Python GUI library
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Tools}
To assist with developing our product we will be using the following tools

\begin{table}[!hbt]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{8cm}|}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Tool Name}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Explanation}} 
	\\ \hline
	Autodesk Inventor
	&  Inventor will be used for all the CAD design work to create our hardware  
	\newline                              
	\\ \hline
	VSCode
	&  Our team will be using VSCode as our primary code editor because of the vast extensions it has. VSCode also integrates nicely with git and GitHub
	\newline                              
	\\ \hline
	GitHub Desktop
	&  GitHub desktop is an easy to use GUI which interacts with our github repo and makes editing code and files faster
	\newline                              
	\\ \hline
	Pylint
	&  The linter extension we plan on using is Pylint, it will keep our coding style consistent between different people and it is specifically made for Python
	\newline                              
	\\ \hline
