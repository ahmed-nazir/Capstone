  ST-DH3 failed the functional test case. The team estimated the time required to design and integrate a rechargeable battery subsystem within the project's timeline was 1.5 weeks and decided the effort was not worthwhile relative to other project objectives. As a result, the failure of this test case lead the expected operation at low battery to be adjusted. Users are now expected to replace the battery on a regular schedule to prevent a failure in test integrity due to charge depletion. \\

  ST-U 1-B failed the usability test case. The difference between ST-U 1-B and ST-U 1-A was the user requirement to adjust and write the Arduino code for a sensor not previously used with the device. Notably, the user experienced difficulty and was intimidated with adjusting existing code to integrate a new sensor. This effect was shown in both the increased time to complete the overall process and the decreased rating in the overall test experience category. As a result, the project will have an approach whereby the user should only interact with the graphical user interface to reduce the user's feelings of complexity and intimidation when integrating a new sensor. The goal is to abstract the adjustments in the backend when implementing a new sensor by having the user interact only with the GUI and following guided steps in plain English to fill in the required information to integrate a new sensor. \\

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
%Each person will have to write a section here. Each FR and NFR will have a paragraph here, so based on what was assigned earlier, we will need to write a section here.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
%NOTE: Only keep requirements in here that were changed
%FR 1 :
%Point 1: Changes
%Point 2: Effect the change had on project
FR 11 was changed such that the battery under expected operational use is non-rechargeable. Batteries will continue to be used but will change from rechargeable to non-rechargeable batteries with a scheduled replacement timeline close to charge depletion. This change followed the test ST-DH 2 results. \\

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

Additional considerations to the GUI must be made in response to NFR1,  NFR2, and the test result ST-U 1-B. In particular, the team plans to improve the GUI to improve the user experience by minimizing and ultimately eliminating interaction with Arduino code when integrating new sensors and making the user work with the GUI to integrate new sensors. \\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)

  %Each person has 1 paragraph on stuff they worked that they can comment on. Ideally, 4 paragraphs total

  %Stephen
  The Verification and Validation Plan for usability differed from the actual activities conducted in the VnV. For example, the usability test ST-U 1 did not originally account sensor code integration by the user during the test. But during VnV, the team realized that we needed to know both the total process time taken when the user already had the required code and when the user had to integrate the code to adequately determe the project's ability to meet the FR's and NFR's defined in the SRS. In the future, prototyping earlier in the design process can help identify important test cases when generating the VnV Plan. \\
