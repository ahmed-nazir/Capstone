\section{Introduction}

A hazard is the combination of a system property with an environmental condition that can cause harm to the intended user.\\

Hazard analysis is a critical consideration in the design of all systems. When done correctly, hazards to the end user are identified and can be mitigated or eliminated completely. While it is not possible to guarantee the safety of a system, applying hazard analysis methods is a neccesary step in supporting the safety of the system. \\

Formulate's area of work combines hardware and software sub-systems and as a result, requires hazard analysis to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the overall system. \\

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

In this document, Formulate details the hazards a user can experience through the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis method. As a result, the group systematically outlined the hazards and measures that were considered to mitigate or eliminate the hazard.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}
