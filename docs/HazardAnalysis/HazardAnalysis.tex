\section{Introduction}

A hazard is the combination of a system property with an environmental condition that can cause harm to the intended user.\\

Hazard analysis is a critical consideration in the design of all systems. When done correctly, hazards to the end user are identified and can be mitigated or eliminated completely. While it is not possible to guarantee the safety of a system, applying hazard analysis methods is a neccesary step in supporting the safety of the system. \\

Formulate's area of work combines hardware and software sub-systems and as a result, requires hazard analysis to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the overall system. \\

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

In this document, Formulate details the hazards a user can experience through the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis method. As a result, the group systematically outlined the hazards and measures that were considered to mitigate or eliminate the hazard.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The device that is referred to in this document is made up of 5 major components that hazard and failure analysis would have to be done for:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Hardware
\item Desktop Application
\item Database
\item Data Website Analytics
\item The Physical Device
\end{enumerate}

Each component has there own system boundaries based on the software and hardware we use. Since this is the case we will have to design the system based on the type of the test that is required to be performed by the MAC Formula Electric Team. An example of this would be if the client had to test their motor at an operating speed we would choose hardware components that are within that temperature range to avoid any failure reading the data correctly or damaging the component.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}



\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

All these requirements will try be implemented during the course of the capstone. The safety and security requirements are important for a complete and safe testing device. As this  is the case most, but hopefully all of them will be implemented but if we can not implement all of them due to our time constraint the ones essential to the design will be implemented while the others that only improve user functionality will be added towards the end.
