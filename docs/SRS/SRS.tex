\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Document Purpose}

This document provides the set of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) used to describe the system developed to assist testing efforts in technical teams. Both hardware and software system requirements were included to fully specify all system requirements. \\

The user can expect to understand the system behavior under expected use cases, the functional and non-functional requirements the system must adhere to, and a phase in development plan.\\

\subsection{Project Description}

Effective test data collection and storage is a common challenge extra-curricular teams face in the technical domain. In teams who do not invest in streamlining data collection and storage, teams cannot fully utilize test data to validate designs. As a result, teams encounter difficulty proving design validity during competition, experience reduced competitiveness when presenting an under-validated system, and fail to generate trends on aggregated test data to efficiently find areas of improvement in design. \\

Project "Formulate" enables engineering teams to streamline data collection and storage, resulting in testing overhead reduction and increased control of raw test data gathered by automating aspects of the testing procedure.\\

\subsection{Project Scope}

Project Formulate aims to provide the McMaster Formula Electric team with a well-documented and complete system. To accomplish the project goals within an 8 month timeline, the following scope of requirements were developed to set clear boundaries on deliverables.\\

1. Documentation for tool integration into testing workflows for common tests.\\
2. Hardware capable of collecting data from test equipment.\\
3. User interface to interact with raw data and submit the data to a database.\\
4. Record of organized, historical data.\\
5. Visualization of test data stored in a database with auto-generated KPI metrics.\\
6. Short setup time to integrate device into testing workflow, regardless of technical background.\\

  Out of Scope Items:\\
1. Custom website to visualize test data results stored in a database.\\
2. Security through data encryption.\\
3. Predictive intelligence to estimate if rate of test data collected is on track to produce a fully validated product.\\

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Formulate consists of 3 main components, each with its own functional requirements. The base device addresses the sensors and physical device which interacts directly with the user, the desktop application is the means for the user to select modes and submit data and the data analytics platform (website) is for the user to view old test case data to check if KPIs are met.

\subsubsection{Priority 1} 

\begin{itemize}
  

  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should connect to a PC wirelessly and wired to transmit data
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should alert the user if any tests exceed the operating condition of the car
  \begin{description} \item[Rationale] If at any point during the test it exceed operating conditions, the base devices should make it obvious to the user  \end{description}
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should have a start button which activates the telemetry between the PC and device and starts reading values
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should have a stop button which stops the telemetry between the PC and device and stops reading values
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should have a screen to display the current status to the user
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should allow users to preview the data after a test

  \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Priority 2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should easily mount to the Formula SAE car

  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should contain a rechargeable battery
  \begin{description} \item[Rationale:] The base device needs its own independent power source which will allow for it to be placed in areas without a power socket. \end{description}

  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The modular sensors should have a snap on mounting mechanism to connect to the base
  \begin{description} \item[Rationale] Modular sensors need to have a rigid connection with the base board with minimal movement to get the most accurate values from the sensor  \end{description}

  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should show live raw data from the sensors

  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should allow the user to send the data to the database
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The website should be able to read the data from the database
  
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should allow the user to trim the data before sending it to the database
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should allow the user to configure the base device's settings
  \begin{description} \item[Rationale:] The base device will need to have the wifi setting configured which will be done in the application \end{description}
  
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Priority 3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The base device should have 4 connection ports to add module sensors to it
  \begin{description} \item[Rationale] Each connection port will make the device more modular and allow for users to add more sensors in the future for other tests.  \end{description}

  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The website should only allow users who have access to view the data
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The website should have the option to filter out the data by test conducted
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The website should show whether the tests passed according to threshold values
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] The application should allow the user to trim the data before sending it to the database
  
  \item[FR \refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum:] Any data pushed to the database should not be editable by the user
  
  \end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\noindent\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Usability} 

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Ease of Learning}\\
    The user will be able to learn the tool's operation quickly to integrate into their testing workflow efficiently\\

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Ease of Use}\\
    The system will be fast at processing data such that additional overhead through the use of the tool is less than if all components of the testing workflow were completed individually.\\

\subsubsection{Performance} 

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Speed}\\
    The system bandwidth will be high enough to support testing equipment with high data collection frequencies.\\

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Reliability and Availability}\\
    The system will be fail-safe to withstand single point of failures in components with high probability of operational failure.\\

\subsubsection{Operational}

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
      \textbf{Expected Technological Environment}\\
    The tool will be able to facilitate a variety of tests using a range of equipment, as long as the equipment is compatible with the data measuring hardware.\\

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Expected Physical Environment}
    The system will be operational under a wide range of temperatures and operational vibrations.\\

\subsubsection{Maintainability and Portability}

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
      \textbf{Maintainability}\\
    The system will be modular and have low cohesion such that users can adapt elements of the tool's hardware and software infrastructure to current needs without breaking other elements.\\

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Portability}\\
    The user's ability to conduct tests will not be affected by the physical constraints from the tool.\\
  
\subsubsection{Security}

    \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum:]
    \textbf{Software Integrity}\\
    The system will be secure against malicious spam aimed at reducing validity of aggregate test data stored in the database.\\

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Starting and stopping the device to get data using hardware
\begin{description} \item[Rationale:] When the device is connected to the computer we can remote start and stop it using software \end{description}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] The base data we are collecting (Vibration, Shock, Temperature, Humidity)
\begin{description} \item[Rationale:] Since the device is set to be modular we might change those initial values we are testing with other ones \end{description}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] The number of modular ports on the base device
\begin{description} \item[Rationale:] When the device is connected to the computer we can remote start and stop it using software \end{description}


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum:] The sensors will remain modular to adapt to different tests that need to be conducted
\begin{description} \item[Rationale:] The product should be expandable in the future to be able to test different values \end{description}

\end{itemize}

\section{Development Plan}

The development plan is categorized into multiple sections, where each section represented a significant phase in the progress of project execution. A section is given a number in the hundreds (X00) to denote a significant phase in the project. Each section is subdivided further into segments given by numbers specified in the tens (XX0) to denote smaller steps within each phase. The expected order of segment completion follows the order of increasing number count; the lowest number segment should be completed first and the highest number segment should be completed last.\\

Each segment has an overall goal that can include the coordination of multiple teammates. Upon completion of each segment, the team members relevant to the segment review and buyoff the readyness of the segment. Upon completion of buying off each segment within a section, the overall phase is considered to be bought off and completed with confidence. The relevant stakeholders must aim to buyoff each segment in a phase before the phase deadline.\\
