\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Document Purpose}

This document provides the set of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) used to describe the system developed to assist testing efforts in technical teams. Both hardware and software system requirements were included to fully specify all system requirements. \\

The user can expect to understand the system behavior under expected use cases, the functional and non-functional requirements the system must adhere to, and a phase in plan.\\

\subsection{Project Description}

Effective test data collection and storage is a common challenge extra-curricular teams face in the technical domain. In teams who do not invest in streamlining data collection and storage, teams cannot fully utilize test data to validate designs. As a result, teams encounter difficulty proving design validity during competition, experience reduced competitiveness when presenting an under-validated system, and fail to generate trends on aggregated test data to efficiently find areas of improvement in design. \\

Project "Formulate" enables Formula teams to streamline data collection and storage, resulting in testing overhead reduction and increased control of raw test data gathered by automating aspects of the testing procedure.\\

\subsection{Project Scope}

Project Formulate aims to provide the McMaster Formula Electric team with a well-documented and complete system. To accomplish the project goals within an 8 month timeline, the following scope of requirements were developed to set clear boundaries on deliverables.\\

\newpage

\noindent
  In of Scope Items:
  \begin{enumerate}
\item Documentation for device integration into testing workflows for common tests
\item Hardware capable of collecting data from test equipment
\item User interface to interact with raw data and submit the data to a database
\item Record of organized, historical data
\item Visualization of test data stored in a database with auto-generated KPI metrics
  \end{enumerate}
  Out of Scope Items:

  \begin{enumerate}
\item Custom website to visualize test data results stored in a database
\item Security through data encryption
\item Predictive intelligence to estimate if rate of test data collected is on track to produce a fully validated product
  \end{enumerate}

\section{User Characteristics}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

Formula Electric teams exemplify a highly technical, extra-curricular engineer-
ing team at the University level. On a yearly basis, these teams compete in com-
petitions organized by a governing body, Formula SAE, who judge the quality
and effectiveness of engineering ideas, designs, fabrications, and tests applied
on a team’s vehicle.\\ 

Specifically, ideal candidates who can benefit from our capstone will be For-
mula Electric teams with 0-4 years of competition experience. Teams without
four years of experience are ideal because they typically cannot finish com-
prehensive tests to validate sub-team designs and overall vehicle design in a
competition year.\\ 

As a result, our primary stakeholder will be McMaster’s Formula Electric
team because the team has 3 years of competition experience and faces difficulty
validating all aspects of the vehicle through comprehensive testing.

\newpage

\subsection{Use Cases} 
\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item \textbf{Device is turned on}\\ The device is turned on and test functioning can begin \item \textbf{Switching of testing}\\ The device would be modular so depending on what test is required the device would be able to change from testing shock, vibrations, temperature, and humidity by just switching the module into the device \item \textbf{Testing functionality}\\ The device will continually send receive information through an Arduino board, the values from the Arduino board will then get converted into a desktop application \item \textbf{Test data conversion}\\ The converted values from the desktop application will be sent to a remote database where the user will be able to access the data and use the information for what it is needed for \item \textbf{Device warning system}\\ The device will be able to tell the user if the equipment being tested is going above or is below the equipment threshold. This will allow the user to stop the testing before any important components get compromised on the unit \item \textbf{Device interrupted or turned off}\\ In event of the device turning of prematurely the data will be automatically saved on the database and stored for later use \item \textbf{User test data access}\\ The user can then access the data on a website where all the info will be stored through our database


  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Consideration}
The design of the device is made with the user in mind, our users will be mainly engineering students trying to collect data on equipment they have designed. Since this is the case they will be able to customize the output parameters for what they need such as the gain and or the initial value of the test. This will allow for a more fluid way to setup the test for them. Since it is a student run club we would like to make it cost effective as well, other data collecting devices are expensive and are hard to set up, we would like to make data collecting for testing faster and cheaper so they are able to have a competitive edge against their competition.

\newpage

\subsection{Impact}
This design could allow for dangerous testing conditions for an unsupervised tester or a person who does not have full knowledge on what they are testing. Since this product is made for people who both fully understand and created what they are testing, they will be able to test the equipment in a safe and unsupervised manner. If this device was given to a person without full knowledge on what they are testing, there is potential to cause damage to what they are testing or even worse, themselves. Another impact would be how testing is done. It can create faster and more efficient testing, resulting in faster production of parts and equipment. This will increase the productivity of numerous companies who are in need of new ways to store their testing data in efficient and accessible ways.

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Formulate consists of 3 main components, each with its own functional requirements. The device addresses the sensors and physical device which interacts directly with the user. The desktop application is the means for the user to select modes and submit data, and the data visualizer (website) is for the user to view old test case data to check if KPI's are met.

\section{Phase in Plan}

The phase in plan is categorized into multiple sections, where each section represented a significant phase in the progress of project execution. A section is given a number in the hundreds (X00) to denote a significant phase in the project. Each section is subdivided further into segments given by numbers specified in the tens (XX0) to denote smaller steps within each phase. The expected order of segment completion follows the order of increasing number count; the lowest number segment should be completed first and the highest number segment should be completed last.\\

Each segment has an overall goal that can include the coordination of multiple team members. Upon completion of each segment, the team members relevant to the segment will review and buyoff the readyness of the segment. Upon completion of buying off each segment within a section, the overall phase is considered to be bought off and completed with confidence. The relevant stakeholders must aim to buyoff each segment in a phase before the phase deadline.\\

The priorities for the Functional Requirements relate to the Phase in Plan because priorities 1, 2, and 3 correlates to the 100, 200, and 300 series phases of the project planning. This method benefits from the ability to assign stakeholders to each segment for project management.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Knowledge Requirement}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Sensors/Embedded Systems:} To successfully complete this project our group needs to collectively understand how sensors and microcontrollers work. The main premise of our project is to automate testing of key components in a Formula Electric vehicle, this can only be done using a variety of sensors to monitor those components. To create almost any hardware device sensors are required as it is equivalent to being the eyes of the device, it allows for hardware to understand and map it's environment. These measurements that the sensor collects can be used by a microcontroller to make decisions on what to do according to the requirements. In our project specifically our hardware device needs to collect measurements from its environment and react accordingly with it, (i.e transmit it to a PC, alert the user if thresholds are exceeded, etc.).
  
  \item \textbf{Project Management:} Project management is a critical skill that we will need to acquire to complete this project with excellent execution. Particularly in our capstone project which utilizes multiple sub-systems working together, a cohesive management strategy is critical. Strong project management skills ensure sub-system goals meet their requirements, and ensure the timely integration of all subsystems.
  
  \item \textbf{Databases:} An essential function of Formulate is to collect test results and store them in a database. Therefore, a complete understanding of creating, accessing, securing, and editing databases is required to achieve that functionality. We are aiming to use a relational database, so all research on these topics will specific to relational databases.
  
  \item \textbf{Presentations:} For our presentation, we will all play a part in presenting and demonstrating how our device works. In our presentation, we will require the knowledge of how the device works and the usefulness of our device. Our knowledge will be learned throughout the making of our capstone project as we get more familiar with its software and hardware components. Our presentation will be a demonstration of our knowledge as we will show how we made it and how it was uniquely designed by us. In order for our presentation to be a success we will have to practice and create a unique way to entertain our audience. This will require creativity from us so that we can stand out from the rest of the presentations, which we will discuss more during our weekly meetings.

\subsection{Knowledge Acquirement }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Sensors/Embedded Systems:} There are many resources to help in mastering the skill, McMaster provides access to a platform called LinkedIn Learning, it provides useful relevant courses to programming an Arduino and how to use sensors. Other online resources such as YouTube also provides similar knowledge in these topics. The best way to learn something in my opinion is by experimenting with the technology, this is called the discovery phase. Getting familiar with the technology by messing around with it drastically improves how comfortable you are with it and how to use it. Ahmed will pursue this because he has some relevant coop experience in sensors and embedded systems and he would like to get more hands on experience working on these technologies. These skills are relevant to the type of work he wants to do in the future.
  
  \item \textbf{Project Management:} One of the approaches our team plans on using to master the skill of project management is to look to our previous or current managers and mentors from internships for advice. There were moments during our internship where these people demonstrated effective project management strategies that we would like to emulate, and they are a great resource to receive advice from on how we can manage our capstone project effectively. In addition, we plan on seeking the advice of Dr. Smith, the professor for our capstone course, and our assigned teaching assistant Timofey Tomashevskiy, to guide areas of capstone project management we do not have experience in. Stephen would like to pursue the approach of seeking the advice of Dr. Smith and Timofey Tomashevskiy. This is because these two individuals are highly experienced with providing capstone project management help, and are much more accessible to our group as students of the capstone course relative to industry professionals.  
  
  \item \textbf{Databases:} Muhanad is currently taking a databases course (3DB3) at McMaster which is an introduction to all the fundamentals of relational databases. This includes the design and creation of legal databases based on relational constraints and the manipulation of data using SQL (Structured Query Language). This course will be very useful in terms of creating a fundamentally sound database. However, online resources will be used to determine where to host a database and how to make it secure in a way where only the application has write access to it. Muhanad is pursuing databases because he interacted with them briefly during his coop and found SQL to be very interesting. Therefore, he wishes to take a more in-depth look at databases and querying languages to gain a full understanding of them.
  
  \newpage
  
  \item \textbf{Presentations:} For our presentation we will all play a part in presenting and demonstrating how our new device. In our presentation we will require the knowledge of how the device works and the usefulness of our device. Our knowledge will be learned throughout the making of our capstone project as we get more familiar with software and hardware. Our presentation will be a demonstration of our knowledge as we will show how we made it and how it is uniquely designed by us. In order for our presentation to be a success, Tioluwalayomi will practice and create a unique way to entertain our audience. This will require creativity to stand out from the rest of the presentations, which we will discuss more during our weekly meetings.
