## Description

Competitive engineering extracurricular activities at the University level revolves around the design, build, test, learn (DBTL) cycle. In teams that have not yet reached maturity in completing high quality and timely DBTL cycles, the design/building phases are over-prioritized, leaving the testing/learning phases under-resourced.
Most teams struggling to achieve timely DBTL cycles compete in deeply technical applications of engineering. Problematically, deeply technical applications demand significant amounts of time into the design/build phase of a competition year to create a working prototype.


Our capstone group recognizes the challenge teams face with the under-allocation of resources for testing, and seek to produce a solution that reduces the time to obtain and store quality testing data and extract value from the raw data they collect.
